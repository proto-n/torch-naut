## Nonparametric Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling Toolkit for PyTorch

**TorchNaut** is a Python package designed for uncertainty modeling in neural networks. It provides:

- Implementations of CPRS loss-based models and Mixture Density Networks  
- Optional support for Bayesian Neural Networks and Deep Ensembles  
- GPU-accelerated adaptive-bandwidth kernel density estimation  
- Multivariate extensions of models  

TorchNaut is built as a utility library, encouraging a *bring-your-own-model* approach. However, for convenience and rapid prototyping, we also provide pre-defined models.
